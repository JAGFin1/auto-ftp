Auto FTP
========

The idea behind Auto FTP is to listen on servers for files that move around often. If you have a remote datastore and need to receive files often, you'll need to manually connect via FTP and download them. Auto FTP will listen on a connection for new files -- files you're interested in -- and will automatically add them to a download queue and process them.
